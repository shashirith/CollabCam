# Welcome to Code2Face

Code2Face is a web platform specifically designed for conducting Online Coding interviews. Interviewers can start a new session call and share the code of the session with the interviewee. The interviewee then uses this session code to join the room where the interviewer is present.

## Features

- collaborative code editor:  which can be used by the student to code and the interviewer to give questions 

- there is also video monitoring functionality for the student , when the student starts their video the head movements of the studnet will be tracked and notified. If the the students moves after a warning the session can ended!

- there will be a chat functionality for communication

- Note : Currently users in the same network are able to connect, this is mostly due to the peerJS implementation I am using. I will try to update the functionality so that anyone from anywhere can connect to each other.

### future scope

- add functionality to help the interviewer conduct consecutive interviews and store the students score
